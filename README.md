#Phase - V  
  
Programming DeFi: Uniswap V3 P1: market makers, markets, and how decentralized exchanges (DEX) work in general  
Programming DeFi: Uniswap V3 P2: make a simple DEX that’s capable of swapping tokens in one direction with predefined prices and amounts  
Programming DeFi: Uniswap V3 *P3*: implement liquidity management and swaps over multiple liquidity positions  
Programming DeFi: Uniswap V3 P4: evolve our DEX implementation to support swaps in both directions and we’ll start implementing mathematical calculations in Solidity  
Programming DeFi: Uniswap V3 P5: go beyond one Uniswap pool and implement chained swaps i.e. swaps between two tokens that don’t have a common pool  
Programming DeFi: Uniswap V3 P6: introducing swap fees and a price oracle
Programming DeFi: Uniswap V3 P7: how Uniswap V3 can be extended with third-party contracts to turn liquidity positions into NFT tokens
